Using JQuery, JQuery Datatables and Bootstrap, please develop an application with a searchable and sortable table 
with at least 5 columns (minimum of a date), 
and at least 150 records,
 and dynamic paging (minimum 10 records).
The application should provide an UI for the user to update/add/delete the data in memory.
 
Once completed, please send a URL to the GitHub repo and URL to the webpage. Be creative!
