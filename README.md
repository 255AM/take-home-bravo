# take-home-bravo
This was a take-home coding exercise for BCG. The requirements were as follows:
  
"Using JQuery, JQuery Datatables and Bootstrap, please develop an application with a searchable and sortable table 
with at least 5 columns (minimum of a date), 
and at least 150 records,
 and dynamic paging (minimum 10 records).
The application should provide an UI for the user to update/add/delete the data in memory.
 
Once completed, please send a URL to the GitHub repo and URL to the webpage. Be creative!"

This project meets all of the requirements listed. The project also brings in Real world data via AJAX, displays and allows for manipulation of that data, without any kind of serverside architecture.
